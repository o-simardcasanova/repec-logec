**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This repository is basically a version adapted for R and the Tidyverse of the [LogEc data](https://logec.repec.org/details.htm).

I update the data manually, so please do not expect any frequent update.

## How it works

I basically copy-paste the data from the website to an ODS file.
